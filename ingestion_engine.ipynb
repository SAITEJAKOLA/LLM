This is the first Budget in Amrit  Kaal.  Introduction  1.  This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous  Budget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous  and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and  citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes.   2.  In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the  Indian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is  estimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all  the major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally  caused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right  track, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.   3.  Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world  appreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders  who had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our  endeavors going forward.  Resilience amidst multiple crises  4.  Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented  through Sabka Prayas resulting in Jan Bhagidari and targeted support to  those in need, helped us perform well in trying times.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed  hungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons  for 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional  security, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply  free food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one  year, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire  expenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central  Government.  G20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges  6.  In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a  unique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order.  With the theme of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, we are steering an  ambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to  facilitate sustainable economic development.   Achievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind  7.  The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a  better quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more  than doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.    8.  In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from  being 10th to 5th largest in the world. We have significantly improved our  position as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive  environment for business as reflected in several global indices. We have  made significant progress in many Sustainable Development Goals.'},\n",

Vision for Amrit Kaal – an empowered and inclusive economy  11.  Our vision for the Amrit Kaal includes technology-driven and  knowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust  financial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka  Prayas is essential.    12.  The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three  things: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the  youth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth  and job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.     13.  To service these focus areas in our journey to India@100, we believe  that the following four opportunities can be transformative during Amrit  Kaal.'},\n",

We will  enable these groups to reach the next stage of economic  empowerment through formation of large producer enterprises or  collectives with each having several thousand members and  managed professionally. They will be helped with supply of raw  materials and for better design, quality, branding and marketing of  their products. Through supporting policies, they will be enabled to  scale up their operations to serve the large consumer markets, as  has been the case with several start-ups growing into ‘Unicorns’.  2) PM VIshwakarma KAushal Samman (PM VIKAS): For centuries,  traditional artisans and craftspeople, who work with their hands  using tools, have brought renown for India. They are generally  referred to as Vishwakarma. The art and handicraft created by them  represents the true spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. For the first time, a  package of assistance for them has been conceptualized. The new  scheme will enable them to improve the quality, scale and reach of  their products, integrating them with the MSME value chain. The  components of the scheme will include not only financial support  but also access to advanced skill training, knowledge of modern  digital techniques and efficient green technologies, brand  promotion, linkage with local and global markets, digital payments,  and social security. This will greatly benefit the Scheduled Castes,  Scheduled Tribes, OBCs, women and people belonging to the weaker  sections.   3) Tourism: The country offers immense attraction for domestic as well  as foreign tourists. There is a large potential to be tapped in tourism.  The sector holds huge opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship  for youth in particular.  Promotion of tourism will be taken up on  mission mode, with active participation of states, convergence of  government programmes and public-private partnerships.'},\n",

I propose to provide  enhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers  whose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support  MSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for  expenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is  actually made.   Cooperation  135.  Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime  Minister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the  spirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the  measures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative  sector.'},\n",

These primarily  benefit our hard-working middle class.  146.  The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to   ` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I  propose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus,  persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to  pay any tax.   147.  The  second  proposal  relates  to  middle-class  individuals.   I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime  with six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax  structure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and  increasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are:  ` 0-3 lakh  Nil  ` 3-6 lakh  5 per cent  ` 6-9 lakh  10 per cent  ` 9-12 lakh  15 per cent  ` 12-15 lakh  20 per cent  Above ` 15 lakh  30 per cent    148.  This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An  individual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only   ` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25  per cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly,  an individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only   ` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent  from the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.   149.

My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the  highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the  highest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37  per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction  of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent.  151.  Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment  on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the  year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/-  pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to  increase this limit to ` 25 lakh.  152.  We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax  regime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the  benefit of the old tax regime.  153.  Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in  the annexure.  154.  As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –   ` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be  forgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized.  Thus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually.  155.  Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to this  august House.  *****'},\n",

       "  'text': '30          Direct Taxes  132.  I now come to my direct tax proposals. These proposals aim to  maintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise  various provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the  entrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens.  133.  It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department  to improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our  tax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day;  processed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period  reduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;   and 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend  to further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form  for tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance  redressal mechanism.   MSMEs and Professionals   134.  MSMEs are growth engines of our economy.  Micro enterprises with  turnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to   ` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide  enhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers  whose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support  MSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for  expenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is  actually made.   Cooperation  135.  Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime  Minister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the  spirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the  measures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative  sector.'},\n",

To better allocate scarce resources for competing development  needs, the financing of select schemes will be changed, on a pilot basis,  from ‘input-based’ to ‘result-based’.  E-Courts   70.  For  efficient  administration  of  justice,  Phase-3  of  the   E-Courts  project  will  be  launched  with  an  outlay   of ` 7,000 crore.   Fintech Services   71.  Fintech services in India have been facilitated by our digital public  infrastructure including Aadhaar, PM Jan Dhan Yojana, Video KYC, India  Stack and UPI. To enable more Fintech innovative services, the scope of  documents available in DigiLocker for individuals will be expanded.   Entity DigiLocker   72.  An Entity DigiLocker will be set up for use by MSMEs, large business  and charitable trusts. This will be towards storing and sharing documents  online securely, whenever needed, with various authorities, regulators,  banks and other business entities.   5G Services  73.  One  hundred  labs  for  developing  applications  using   5G services will be set up in engineering institutions to realise a new range  of opportunities, business models, and employment potential.

B.7  Extension of date of incorporation for eligible start up for  exemption   Certain start-ups are eligible for some tax benefit if they are  incorporated before 1st April, 2023. The period of incorporation of  such eligible start-ups is proposed to be extended by one year to  before 1st April, 2024.   B.8  Gold to Electronic Gold Receipt  The conversion of physical gold to Electronic Gold Receipt and vice  versa is proposed not to be treated as a transfer and not to attract  any capital gains. This would promote investments in electronic  equivalent of gold.  B.9  Incentives to IFSC  Relocation of funds to IFSC has certain tax exemptions, if the  relocation is before 31.03.2023. This date is proposed to be  extended to 31.03.2025. Further, any distributed income from the  offshore derivative instruments entered into with an offshore  banking unit is also proposed to be exempted subject to certain  conditions.  B.10  Exemption to development authorities etc.  It is proposed to provide exemption to any income arising to a  body or authority or board or trust or commission, (not being a  company) which  has been established or constituted by or under  a Central or State Act with the purposes of satisfying the need for  housing or for planning, development or improvement of cities,  towns and villages or for regulating any activity or matter,  irrespective of whether it is carrying out commercial activity.  B.11  Facilitating certain strategic disinvestments  To facilitate certain strategic disinvestments, it is proposed to  allow carry forward of accumulated losses and unabsorbed  depreciation allowance in the case of amalgamation of one or  more banking company with any other banking institution or a  company subsequent to a strategic disinvestment, if such  amalgamation  takes  place  within  5  years  of  strategic  disinvestment. It is also proposed to modify the definition of  ‘strategic disinvestment’.'}]"

This is the first Budget in Amrit Kaal. Introduction 1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous Budget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the Indian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is estimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all the major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally caused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right track, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future. 3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world appreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders who had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our endeavors going forward. Resilience amidst multiple crises 4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented through Sabka Prayas resulting in Jan Bhagidari and targeted support to those in need, helped us perform well in trying times.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed hungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons for 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional security, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply free food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one year, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire expenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central Government. G20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges 6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a unique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. With the theme of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, we are steering an ambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to facilitate sustainable economic development. Achievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind 7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a better quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more than doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.  8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from being 10th to 5th largest in the world. We have significantly improved our position as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive environment for business as reflected in several global indices. We have made significant progress in many Sustainable Development Goals.', 'chunk_char_count': 1773, 'chunk_word_count': 285, 'chunk_token_count': 443.25}, {'page_number': 1, 'sentence_chunk': '3    9. The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the EPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital payments of ` 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.  10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with universalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. Some of the schemes are: i. 11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,  ii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,  iii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,   iv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts, v. Insurance cover for 44.6 crore persons under PM Suraksha Bima and PM Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, and vi. Cash transfer of ` 2.2 lakh crore to over 11.4 crore farmers under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Vision for Amrit Kaal – an empowered and inclusive economy 11.

We have adhered to this path, and I reiterate my intention to bring the fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26. 117. To finance the fiscal deficit in 2023-24, the net market borrowings from dated securities are estimated at ` 11.8 lakh crore.

My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic manufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy and mobility. 119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing compliance burden and improving tax administration. I propose to reduce the number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and agriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic custom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, bicycles, automobiles and naphtha.  Green Mobility 120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, I propose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained in it. To further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption is being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for manufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. Electronics  121. As a result of various initiatives of the Government, including the Phased Manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in India has increased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ` 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to 31 crore units valued at over ` 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year. To further deepen domestic value addition in manufacture of mobile phones, I propose to provide relief in customs duty on import of certain parts and inputs like camera lens and continue the concessional duty on lithium-ion cells for batteries for another year.', 'chunk_char_count': 1525, 'chunk_word_count': 246, 'chunk_token_count': 381.25}, {'page_number': 26, 'sentence_chunk': '28    122. Similarly, to promote value addition in manufacture of televisions, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on parts of open cells of TV panels to 2.5 per cent. Electrical  123. To rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing of electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen chimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on heat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. Chemicals and Petrochemicals  124. Denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry. I propose to exempt basic customs duty on it. This will also support the Ethanol Blending Programme and facilitate our endeavour for energy transition. Basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals industry competitive. Further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for use in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Marine products 125. In the last financial year, marine products recorded the highest export growth benefitting farmers in the coastal states of the country. To further enhance the export competitiveness of marine products, particularly shrimps, duty is being reduced on key inputs for domestic manufacture of shrimp feed. Lab Grown Diamonds 126. India is a global leader in cutting and polishing of natural diamonds, contributing about three-fourths of the global turnover by value. With the depletion in deposits of natural diamonds, the industry is moving towards Lab Grown Diamonds (LGDs) and it holds huge promise. To seize this', 'chunk_char_count': 1667, 'chunk_word_count': 277, 'chunk_token_count': 416.75}, {'page_number': 27, 'sentence_chunk': '29    opportunity, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on seeds used in their manufacture.  Precious Metals 127. Customs Duties on dore and bars of gold and platinum were increased earlier this fiscal. I now propose to increase the duties on articles made therefrom to enhance the duty differential. I also propose to increase the import duty on silver dore, bars and articles to align them with that on gold and platinum. Metals 128. To facilitate availability of raw materials for the steel sector, exemption from Basic Customs Duty on raw materials for manufacture of CRGO Steel, ferrous scrap and nickel cathode is being continued. 129. Similarly, the concessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap is also being continued to ensure the availability of raw materials for secondary copper producers who are mainly in the MSME sector. Compounded Rubber 130. The basic customs duty rate on compounded rubber is being increased from 10 per cent to ‘25 per cent or ` 30/kg whichever is lower’, at par with that on natural rubber other than latex, to curb circumvention of duty. Cigarettes 131. National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on specified cigarettes was last revised three years ago.

I now come to my direct tax proposals. These proposals aim to maintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise various provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the entrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. 133. It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department to improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our tax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; processed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period reduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  and 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend to further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form for tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism. MSMEs and Professionals  134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy. Micro enterprises with turnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  ` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide enhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers whose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support MSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for expenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is actually made. Cooperation 135. Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime Minister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the spirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the measures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative sector.', 'chunk_char_count': 1728, 'chunk_word_count': 297, 'chunk_token_count': 432.0}, {'page_number': 29, 'sentence_chunk': '31    136. First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till 31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is presently available to new manufacturing companies. 137. Secondly, I propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives to claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to assessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them with a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore. 138. Thirdly, I am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash deposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies (PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDBs). 139. Similarly, a higher limit of ` 3 crore for TDS on cash withdrawal is being provided to co-operative societies. Start-Ups 140. Entrepreneurship is vital for a country’s economic development. We have taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results. India is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks second in innovation quality among middle-income countries. I propose to extend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from 31.03.23 to 31.3.24. I further propose to provide the benefit of carry forward of losses on change of shareholding of start-ups from seven years of incorporation to ten years. Appeals 141. To reduce the pendency of appeals at Commissioner level, I propose to deploy about 100 Joint Commissioners for disposal of small appeals. We shall also be more selective in taking up cases for scrutiny of returns already received this year.', 'chunk_char_count': 1622, 'chunk_word_count': 263, 'chunk_token_count': 405.5}, {'page_number': 30, 'sentence_chunk': '32    Better targeting of tax concessions 142. For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions,  I propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential house under sections 54 and 54F to ` 10 crore. Another proposal with similar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance policies with very high value. Rationalisation 143. There are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and simplification. Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by statutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of cities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an activity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax. Other major measures in this direction are: \\uf0b7 Removing the minimum threshold of ` 10,000/- for TDS and clarifying taxability relating to online gaming; \\uf0b7 Not treating conversion of gold into electronic gold receipt and vice versa as capital gain;  \\uf0b7 Reducing the TDS rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent on taxable portion of EPF withdrawal in non-PAN cases; and \\uf0b7 Taxation on income from Market Linked Debentures. Others 144. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to the following: \\uf0b7 Extension of period of tax benefits to funds relocating to IFSC, GIFT City till 31.03.2025; \\uf0b7 Decriminalisation under section 276A of the Income Tax Act; \\uf0b7 Allowing carry forward of losses on strategic disinvestment including that of IDBI Bank; and \\uf0b7 Providing EEE status to Agniveer Fund.', 'chunk_char_count': 1510, 'chunk_word_count': 251, 'chunk_token_count': 377.5}, {'page_number': 31, 'sentence_chunk': '33    Personal Income Tax 145. Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I have five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily benefit our hard-working middle class. 146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  ` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I propose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to pay any tax. 147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime with six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax structure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and increasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: ` 0-3 lakh Nil ` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent ` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent ` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent ` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent Above ` 15 lakh 30 per cent  148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An individual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  ` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 per cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, an individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  ` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent from the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  149. My third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners including family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of', 'chunk_char_count': 1649, 'chunk_word_count': 335, 'chunk_token_count': 412.25}, {'page_number': 32, 'sentence_chunk': '34    standard deduction to the new tax regime. Each salaried person with an income of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. 150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the highest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. 151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to increase this limit to ` 25 lakh. 152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax regime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the benefit of the old tax regime. 153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in the annexure. 154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  ` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be forgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. Thus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. 155.

PROVIDING TAX RELIEF UNDER NEW PERSONAL TAX REGIME A.1   The new tax regime for Individual and HUF, introduced by the Finance Act 2020, is now proposed to be the default regime. A.2   This regime would also become the default regime for AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP. A.3   Any individual, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI or AJP not willing to be taxed under this new regime can opt to be taxed under the old regime. For those person having income under the head “profit and gains of business or profession” and having opted for old regime can revoke that option only once and after that they will continue to be taxed under the new regime.

It is proposed that the for those individuals, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP under the new regime, surcharge would be same except that the surcharge rate of 37 per cent will not apply. Highest surcharge shall be 25 per cent for income above  ` 2 crore. This would reduce the maximum rate from about 42.7 per cent to about 39 per cent. No change in surcharge is proposed for those who opt to be under the old regime. A.8   Encashment of earned leave up to 10 months of average salary, at the time of retirement in case of an employee (other than an employee of the Central Government or State Government), is exempt under sub-clause (ii) of clause (10AA) of section 10 of the Income-tax Act (“the Act”) to the extent notified.

      "['Budget 2023-2024  Speech of Nirmala Sitharaman Minister of Finance February 1, 2023 Hon’ble Speaker,   I present the Budget for 2023-24. This is the first Budget in Amrit Kaal. Introduction 1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous Budget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the Indian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is estimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all the major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally caused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right track, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future. 3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world appreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders who had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our endeavors going forward. Resilience amidst multiple crises 4. Our focus on wide-ranging reforms and sound policies, implemented through Sabka Prayas resulting in Jan Bhagidari and targeted support to those in need, helped us perform well in trying times. India’s rising global', '2    profile is because of several accomplishments: unique world class digital public infrastructure, e.g., Aadhaar, Co-Win and UPI; Covid vaccination drive in unparalleled scale and speed; proactive role in frontier areas such as achieving the climate related goals, mission LiFE, and National Hydrogen Mission. 5. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed hungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons for 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional security, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply free food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one year, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire expenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central Government. G20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges 6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a unique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. With the theme of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, we are steering an ambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to facilitate sustainable economic development. Achievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind 7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a better quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more than doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.  8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from being 10th to 5th largest in the world. We have significantly improved our position as a well-governed and innovative country with a conducive environment for business as reflected in several global indices. We have made significant progress in many Sustainable Development Goals.', '3    9. The economy has become a lot more formalised as reflected in the EPFO membership more than doubling to 27 crore, and 7,400 crore digital payments of ` 126 lakh crore through UPI in 2022.  10. The efficient implementation of many schemes, with universalisation of targeted benefits, has resulted in inclusive development. Some of the schemes are: i. 11.7 crore household toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission,  ii. 9.6 crore LPG connections under Ujjawala,  iii. 220 crore Covid vaccination of 102 crore persons,   iv. 47.8 crore PM Jan Dhan bank accounts, v. Insurance cover for 44.6 crore persons under PM Suraksha Bima and PM Jeevan Jyoti Yojana, and vi. Cash transfer of ` 2.2 lakh crore to over 11.4 crore farmers under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi. Vision for Amrit Kaal – an empowered and inclusive economy 11. Our vision for the Amrit Kaal includes technology-driven and knowledge-based economy with strong public finances, and a robust financial sector. To achieve this, Jan Bhagidari through Sabka Saath Sabka Prayas is essential.  12. The economic agenda for achieving this vision focuses on three things: first, facilitating ample opportunities for citizens, especially the youth, to fulfil their aspirations; second, providing strong impetus to growth and job creation; and third, strengthening macro-economic stability.  13. To service these focus areas in our journey to India@100, we believe that the following four opportunities can be transformative during Amrit Kaal.', '4    1) Economic Empowerment of Women: Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana National Rural Livelihood Mission has achieved remarkable success by mobilizing rural women into 81 lakh Self Help Groups. We will enable these groups to reach the next stage of economic empowerment through formation of large producer enterprises or collectives with each having several thousand members and managed professionally. They will be helped with supply of raw materials and for better design, quality, branding and marketing of their products. Through supporting policies, they will be enabled to scale up their operations to serve the large consumer markets, as has been the case with several start-ups growing into ‘Unicorns’. 2) PM VIshwakarma KAushal Samman (PM VIKAS): For centuries, traditional artisans and craftspeople, who work with their hands using tools, have brought renown for India. They are generally referred to as Vishwakarma. The art and handicraft created by them represents the true spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat. For the first time, a package of assistance for them has been conceptualized. The new scheme will enable them to improve the quality, scale and reach of their products, integrating them with the MSME value chain. The components of the scheme will include not only financial support but also access to advanced skill training, knowledge of modern digital techniques and efficient green technologies, brand promotion, linkage with local and global markets, digital payments, and social security. This will greatly benefit the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs, women and people belonging to the weaker sections. 3) Tourism: The country offers immense attraction for domestic as well as foreign tourists. There is a large potential to be tapped in tourism. The sector holds huge opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship for youth in particular. Promotion of tourism will be taken up on mission mode, with active participation of states, convergence of government programmes and public-private partnerships.', '5    4) Green Growth: We are implementing many programmes for green fuel, green energy, green farming, green mobility, green buildings, and green equipment, and policies for efficient use of energy across various economic sectors. These green growth efforts help in reducing carbon intensity of the economy and provides for large- scale green job opportunities. Priorities of this Budget 14. The Budget adopts the following seven priorities. They complement each other and act as the ‘Saptarishi’ guiding us through the Amrit Kaal. 1) Inclusive Development  2) Reaching the Last Mile 3) Infrastructure and Investment 4) Unleashing the Potential 5) Green Growth 6) Youth Power  7) Financial Sector Priority 1: Inclusive Development  15. The Government’s philosophy of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas has facilitated inclusive development covering in specific, farmers, women, youth, OBCs, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, divyangjan and economically weaker sections, and overall priority for the underprivileged (vanchiton ko variyata). There has also been a sustained focus on Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and the North-East. This Budget builds on those efforts. Agriculture and Cooperation  Digital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture 16. Digital public infrastructure for agriculture will be built as an open source, open standard and inter operable public good. This will enable', \"6    inclusive, farmer-centric solutions through relevant information services for crop planning and health, improved access to farm inputs, credit, and insurance, help for crop estimation, market intelligence, and support for growth of agri-tech industry and start-ups. Agriculture Accelerator Fund 17. An Agriculture Accelerator Fund will be set-up to encourage agri- startups by young entrepreneurs in rural areas. The Fund will aim at bringing innovative and affordable solutions for challenges faced by farmers. It will also bring in modern technologies to transform agricultural practices, increase productivity and profitability. Enhancing productivity of cotton crop  18. To enhance the productivity of extra-long staple cotton, we will adopt a cluster-based and value chain approach through Public Private Partnerships (PPP). This will mean collaboration between farmers, state and industry for input supplies, extension services, and market linkages. Atmanirbhar Horticulture Clean Plant Program  19. We will launch an Atmanirbhar Clean Plant Program to boost availability of disease-free, quality planting material for high value horticultural crops at an outlay of ` 2,200 crore. Global Hub for Millets: ‘Shree Anna’ 20. “India is at the forefront of popularizing Millets, whose consumption furthers nutrition, food security and welfare of farmers,” said Hon’ble Prime Minister. 21. We are the largest producer and second largest exporter of ‘Shree Anna’ in the world. We grow several types of 'Shree Anna' such as jowar, ragi, bajra, kuttu, ramdana, kangni, kutki, kodo, cheena, and sama. These have a number of health benefits, and have been an integral part of our food for centuries. I acknowledge with pride the huge service done by small\", \"7    farmers in contributing to the health of fellow citizens by growing these ‘Shree Anna’. 22. Now to make India a global hub for 'Shree Anna', the Indian Institute of Millet Research, Hyderabad will be supported as the Centre of Excellence for sharing best practices, research and technologies at the international level.  Agriculture Credit  23. The agriculture credit target will be increased  to ` 20 lakh crore with focus on animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries. Fisheries 24. We will launch a new sub-scheme of PM Matsya Sampada Yojana with targeted investment of ` 6,000 crore to further enable activities of fishermen, fish vendors, and micro & small enterprises, improve value chain efficiencies, and expand the market. Cooperation 25. For farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, and other marginalised sections, the government is promoting cooperative-based economic development model. A new Ministry of Cooperation was formed with a mandate to realise the vision of ‘Sahakar Se Samriddhi’. To realise this vision, the government has already initiated computerisation of 63,000 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) with an investment of ` 2,516 crore. In consultation with all stakeholders and states, model bye-laws for PACS were formulated enabling them to become multipurpose PACS. A national cooperative database is being prepared for country-wide mapping of cooperative societies. 26. With this backdrop, we will implement a plan to set up massive decentralised storage capacity. This will help farmers store their produce and realize remunerative prices through sale at appropriate times. The government will also facilitate setting up of a large number of multipurpose\", '8    cooperative societies, primary fishery societies and dairy cooperative societies in uncovered panchayats and villages in the next 5 years. Health, Education and Skilling Nursing Colleges  27. One hundred and fifty-seven new nursing colleges will be established in co-location with the existing 157 medical colleges established since 2014. Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission 28. A Mission to eliminate Sickle Cell Anaemia by 2047 will be launched. It will entail awareness creation, universal screening of 7 crore people in the age group of 0-40 years in affected tribal areas, and counselling through collaborative efforts of central ministries and state governments. Medical Research  29. Facilities in select ICMR Labs will be made available for research by public and private medical college faculty and private sector R&D teams for encouraging collaborative research and innovation. Pharma Innovation  30. A new programme to promote research and innovation in pharmaceuticals will be taken up through centers of excellence. We shall also encourage industry to invest in research and development in specific priority areas. Multidisciplinary courses for medical devices 31. Dedicated multidisciplinary courses for medical devices will be supported in existing institutions to ensure availability of skilled manpower for futuristic medical technologies, high-end manufacturing and research.', '9    Teachers’ Training 32. Teachers’ training will be re-envisioned through innovative pedagogy, curriculum transaction, continuous professional development, dipstick surveys, and ICT implementation. The District Institutes of Education and Training will be developed as vibrant institutes of excellence for this purpose.  National Digital Library for Children and Adolescents  33. A National Digital Library for children and adolescents will be set-up for facilitating availability of quality books across geographies, languages, genres and levels, and device agnostic accessibility. States will be encouraged to set up physical libraries for them at panchayat and ward levels and provide infrastructure for accessing the National Digital Library resources. 34. Additionally, to build a culture of reading, and to make up for pandemic-time learning loss, the National Book Trust, Children’s Book Trust and other sources will be encouraged to provide and replenish non- curricular titles in regional languages and English to these physical libraries. Collaboration with NGOs that work in literacy will also be a part of this initiative. To inculcate financial literacy, financial sector regulators and organizations will be encouraged to provide age-appropriate reading material to these libraries. Priority 2: Reaching the Last Mile 35. Prime Minister Vajpayee’s government had formed the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and the Department of Development of North-Eastern Region. To provide a sharper focus to the objective of ‘reaching the last mile’, our government has formed the ministries of AYUSH, Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Skill Development, Jal Shakti and Cooperation.', '10    Aspirational Districts and Blocks Programme 36. Building on the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, the Government has recently launched the Aspirational Blocks Programme covering 500 blocks for saturation of essential government services across multiple domains such as health, nutrition, education, agriculture, water resources, financial inclusion, skill development, and basic infrastructure. Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission 37. To improve socio-economic conditions of the particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission will be launched. This will saturate PVTG families and habitations with basic facilities such as safe housing, clean drinking water and sanitation, improved access to education, health and nutrition, road and telecom connectivity, and sustainable livelihood opportunities. An amount  of ` 15,000 crore will be made available to implement the Mission in the next three years under the Development Action Plan for the Scheduled Tribes. Eklavya Model Residential Schools 38. In the next three years, centre will recruit 38,800 teachers and support staff for the 740 Eklavya Model Residential Schools, serving 3.5 lakh tribal students. Water for Drought Prone Region 39. In the drought prone central region of Karnataka, central assistance of ` 5,300 crore will be given to Upper Bhadra Project to provide sustainable micro irrigation and filling up of surface tanks for drinking water. PM Awas Yojana 40. The outlay for PM Awas Yojana is being enhanced  by 66 per cent to over ` 79,000 crore.', '11    Bharat Shared Repository of Inscriptions (Bharat SHRI) 41. ‘Bharat Shared Repository of Inscriptions’ will be set up in a digital epigraphy museum, with digitization of one lakh ancient inscriptions in the first stage.  Support for poor prisoners 42. For poor persons who are in prisons and unable to afford the penalty or the bail amount, required financial support will be provided.   Priority 3: Infrastructure & Investment 43. Investments in Infrastructure and productive capacity have a large multiplier impact on growth and employment. After the subdued period of the pandemic, private investments are growing again. The Budget takes the lead once again to ramp up the virtuous cycle of investment and job creation.   Capital Investment as driver of growth and jobs 44. Capital investment outlay is being increased steeply for the third year in a row by 33 per cent to ` 10 lakh crore, which would be 3.3 per cent of GDP. This will be almost three times the outlay in 2019-20.  45. This substantial increase in recent years is central to the government’s efforts to enhance growth potential and job creation, crowd- in private investments, and provide a cushion against global headwinds. Effective Capital Expenditure  46. The direct capital investment by the Centre is complemented by the provision made for creation of capital assets through Grants-in-Aid to States. The ‘Effective Capital Expenditure’ of the Centre is budgeted at  ` 13.7 lakh crore, which will be 4.5 per cent of GDP.', '12    Support to State Governments for Capital Investment 47. I have decided to continue the 50-year interest free loan to state governments for one more year to spur investment in infrastructure and to incentivize them for complementary policy actions, with a significantly enhanced outlay of ` 1.3 lakh crore.  Enhancing opportunities for private investment in Infrastructure 48. The newly established Infrastructure Finance Secretariat will assist all stakeholders for more private investment in infrastructure, including railways, roads, urban infrastructure and power, which are predominantly dependent on public resources. Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure 49. The Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure will be reviewed by an expert committee for recommending the classification and financing framework suitable for Amrit Kaal. Railways 50. A capital outlay of ` 2.40 lakh crore has been provided for the Railways. This highest ever outlay is about 9 times the outlay made in 2013- 14. Logistics 51. One hundred critical transport infrastructure projects, for last and first mile connectivity for ports, coal, steel, fertilizer, and food grains sectors have been identified. They will be taken up on priority with investment of ` 75,000 crore, including ` 15,000 crore from private sources. Regional Connectivity 52. Fifty additional airports, heliports, water aerodromes and advance landing grounds will be revived for improving regional air connectivity.', '13    Sustainable Cities of Tomorrow 53. States and cities will be encouraged to undertake urban planning reforms and actions to transform our cities into ‘sustainable cities of tomorrow’. This means efficient use of land resources, adequate resources for urban infrastructure, transit-oriented development, enhanced availability and affordability of urban land, and opportunities for all. Making Cities ready for Municipal Bonds 54. Through property tax governance reforms and ring-fencing user charges on urban infrastructure, cities will be incentivized to improve their credit worthiness for municipal bonds.  Urban Infrastructure Development Fund  55. Like the RIDF, an Urban Infrastructure Development Fund (UIDF) will be established through use of priority sector lending shortfall. This will be managed by the National Housing Bank, and will be used by public agencies to create urban infrastructure in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. States will be encouraged to leverage resources from the grants of the 15th Finance Commission, as well as existing schemes, to adopt appropriate user charges while accessing the UIDF. We expect to make  available ` 10,000 crore per annum for this purpose. Urban Sanitation 56. All cities and towns will be enabled for 100 per cent mechanical desludging of septic tanks and sewers to transition from manhole to machine-hole mode. Enhanced focus will be provided for scientific management of dry and wet waste. Priority 4: Unleashing the Potential 57. “Good Governance is the key to a nation’s progress. Our government is committed to providing a transparent and accountable administration which works for the betterment and welfare of the common citizen,” said Hon’ble Prime Minister.', '14    Mission Karmayogi 58. Under Mission Karmayogi, Centre, States and Union Territories are making and implementing capacity-building plans for civil servants. The government has also launched an integrated online training platform, iGOT Karmayogi, to provide continuous learning opportunities for lakhs of government employees to upgrade their skills and facilitate people-centric approach.  59. For enhancing ease of doing business, more than  39,000 compliances have been reduced and more than  3,400 legal provisions have been decriminalized. For furthering the trust- based governance, we have introduced the Jan Vishwas Bill to amend 42 Central Acts. This Budget proposes a series of measures to unleash the potential of our economy. Centres of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence 60. For realizing the vision of “Make AI in India and Make AI work for India”, three centres of excellence for Artificial Intelligence will be set-up in top educational institutions. Leading industry players will partner in conducting interdisciplinary research, develop cutting-edge applications and scalable problem solutions in the areas of agriculture, health, and sustainable cities. This will galvanize an effective AI ecosystem and nurture quality human resources in the field. National Data Governance Policy 61. To unleash innovation and research by start-ups and academia, a National Data Governance Policy will be brought out. This will enable access to anonymized data. Simplification of Know Your Customer (KYC) process  62. The KYC process will be simplified adopting a ‘risk-based’ instead of ‘one size fits all’ approach. The financial sector regulators will also be', '15    encouraged to have a KYC system fully amenable to meet the needs of Digital India. One stop solution for identity and address updating 63.

In addition to aspects such as physical connectivity, virtual connectivity, tourist guides, high standards for food streets and tourists’ security, all the relevant aspects would be made available on an App to enhance tourist experience. Every destination would be developed as a complete package. The focus of development of tourism would be on domestic as well as foreign tourists. 94. Sector specific skilling and entrepreneurship development will be dovetailed to achieve the objectives of the ‘Dekho Apna Desh’ initiative. This was launched as an appeal by the Prime Minister to the middle class to prefer domestic tourism over international tourism.

I am happy to announce that the revamped scheme will take effect', '22    from 1st April 2023 through infusion of ` 9,000 crore in the corpus. This will enable additional collateral-free guaranteed credit of ` 2 lakh crore. Further, the cost of the credit will be reduced by about 1 per cent.   National Financial Information Registry 98. A national financial information registry will be set up to serve as the central repository of financial and ancillary information. This will facilitate efficient flow of credit, promote financial inclusion, and foster financial stability. A new legislative framework will govern this credit public infrastructure, and it will be designed in consultation with the RBI. Financial Sector Regulations  99. To meet the needs of Amrit Kaal and to facilitate optimum regulation in the financial sector, public consultation, as necessary and feasible, will be brought to the process of regulation-making and issuing subsidiary directions. 100. To simplify, ease and reduce cost of compliance, financial sector regulators will be requested to carry out a comprehensive review of existing regulations. For this, they will consider suggestions from public and regulated entities. Time limits to decide the applications under various regulations will also be laid down. GIFT IFSC  101. To enhance business activities in GIFT IFSC, the following measures will be taken: \\uf0b7 Delegating powers under the SEZ Act to IFSCA to avoid dual regulation, \\uf0b7 Setting up a single window IT system for registration and approval from IFSCA, SEZ authorities, GSTN, RBI, SEBI and IRDAI,', '23    \\uf0b7 Permitting acquisition financing by IFSC Banking Units of foreign banks,  \\uf0b7 Establishing a subsidiary of EXIM Bank for trade  re-financing, \\uf0b7 Amending IFSCA Act for statutory provisions for arbitration, ancillary services, and avoiding dual regulation under SEZ Act, and \\uf0b7 Recognizing offshore derivative instruments as valid contracts.

For commemorating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, a one-time new small savings scheme, Mahila Samman Savings Certificate, will be made available for a two-year period up to March 2025. This will offer deposit facility upto ` 2 lakh in the name of women or girls for a tenor of 2 years at fixed interest rate of 7.5 per cent with partial withdrawal option. Senior Citizens 109.

The maximum deposit limit for Monthly Income Account Scheme will be enhanced from ` 4.5 lakh to ` 9 lakh for single account and from ` 9 lakh to ` 15 lakh for joint account. Fiscal Management Fifty-year interest free loan to States 111. The entire fifty-year loan to states has to be spent on capital expenditure within 2023-24. Most of this will be at the discretion of states, but a part will be conditional on states increasing their actual capital', '25    expenditure. Parts of the outlay will also be linked to, or allocated for, the following purposes: \\uf0b7 Scrapping old government vehicles, \\uf0b7 Urban planning reforms and actions, \\uf0b7 Financing reforms in urban local bodies to make them creditworthy for municipal bonds, \\uf0b7 Housing for police personnel above or as part of police stations,  \\uf0b7 Constructing Unity Malls, \\uf0b7 Children and adolescents’ libraries and digital infrastructure, and \\uf0b7 State share of capital expenditure of central schemes. Fiscal Deficit of States 112. States will be allowed a fiscal deficit of 3.5 per cent of GSDP of which 0.5 per cent will be tied to power sector reforms. Revised Estimates 2022-23 113. The Revised Estimate of the total receipts other than borrowings is  ` 24.3 lakh crore, of which the net tax receipts  are ` 20.9 lakh crore. The Revised Estimate of the total expenditure is  ` 41.9 lakh crore, of which the capital expenditure is about ` 7.3 lakh crore.   114. The Revised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 6.4 per cent of GDP, adhering to the Budget Estimate.    Budget Estimates 2023-24 115. Coming to 2023-24, the total receipts other than borrowings and the total expenditure are estimated at ` 27.2 lakh crore and ` 45 lakh crore respectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 23.3 lakh crore.', '26    116. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 5.9 per cent of GDP. In my Budget Speech for 2021-22, I had announced that we plan to continue the path of fiscal consolidation, reaching a fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26 with a fairly steady decline over the period. We have adhered to this path, and I reiterate my intention to bring the fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26. 117. To finance the fiscal deficit in 2023-24, the net market borrowings from dated securities are estimated at ` 11.8 lakh crore. The balance financing is expected to come from small savings and other sources. The gross market borrowings are estimated at ` 15.4 lakh crore. I will, now, move to Part B.', '27    PART B Indirect Taxes 118. My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic manufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy and mobility. 119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing compliance burden and improving tax administration. I propose to reduce the number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and agriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic custom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, bicycles, automobiles and naphtha.  Green Mobility 120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, I propose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained in it. To further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption is being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for manufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. Electronics  121. As a result of various initiatives of the Government, including the Phased Manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in India has increased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ` 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to 31 crore units valued at over ` 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year. To further deepen domestic value addition in manufacture of mobile phones, I propose to provide relief in customs duty on import of certain parts and inputs like camera lens and continue the concessional duty on lithium-ion cells for batteries for another year.', '28    122. Similarly, to promote value addition in manufacture of televisions, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on parts of open cells of TV panels to 2.5 per cent. Electrical  123. To rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing of electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen chimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on heat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. Chemicals and Petrochemicals  124. Denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry. I propose to exempt basic customs duty on it. This will also support the Ethanol Blending Programme and facilitate our endeavour for energy transition. Basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals industry competitive. Further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for use in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Marine products 125. In the last financial year, marine products recorded the highest export growth benefitting farmers in the coastal states of the country. To further enhance the export competitiveness of marine products, particularly shrimps, duty is being reduced on key inputs for domestic manufacture of shrimp feed. Lab Grown Diamonds 126. India is a global leader in cutting and polishing of natural diamonds, contributing about three-fourths of the global turnover by value. With the depletion in deposits of natural diamonds, the industry is moving towards Lab Grown Diamonds (LGDs) and it holds huge promise. To seize this', '29    opportunity, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on seeds used in their manufacture.  Precious Metals 127. Customs Duties on dore and bars of gold and platinum were increased earlier this fiscal. I now propose to increase the duties on articles made therefrom to enhance the duty differential. I also propose to increase the import duty on silver dore, bars and articles to align them with that on gold and platinum. Metals 128. To facilitate availability of raw materials for the steel sector, exemption from Basic Customs Duty on raw materials for manufacture of CRGO Steel, ferrous scrap and nickel cathode is being continued. 129. Similarly, the concessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap is also being continued to ensure the availability of raw materials for secondary copper producers who are mainly in the MSME sector. Compounded Rubber 130. The basic customs duty rate on compounded rubber is being increased from 10 per cent to ‘25 per cent or ` 30/kg whichever is lower’, at par with that on natural rubber other than latex, to curb circumvention of duty. Cigarettes 131. National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on specified cigarettes was last revised three years ago. This is proposed to be revised upwards by about 16 per cent.', '30     Direct Taxes 132. I now come to my direct tax proposals. These proposals aim to maintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise various provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the entrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. 133. It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department to improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our tax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; processed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period reduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  and 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend to further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form for tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism. MSMEs and Professionals  134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy. Micro enterprises with turnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  ` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide enhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers whose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support MSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for expenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is actually made. Cooperation 135. Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime Minister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the spirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the measures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative sector.', '31    136. First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till 31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is presently available to new manufacturing companies. 137. Secondly, I propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives to claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to assessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them with a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore. 138. Thirdly, I am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash deposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies (PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDBs). 139. Similarly, a higher limit of ` 3 crore for TDS on cash withdrawal is being provided to co-operative societies. Start-Ups 140. Entrepreneurship is vital for a country’s economic development. We have taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results. India is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks second in innovation quality among middle-income countries. I propose to extend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from 31.03.23 to 31.3.24. I further propose to provide the benefit of carry forward of losses on change of shareholding of start-ups from seven years of incorporation to ten years. Appeals 141. To reduce the pendency of appeals at Commissioner level, I propose to deploy about 100 Joint Commissioners for disposal of small appeals. We shall also be more selective in taking up cases for scrutiny of returns already received this year.', '32    Better targeting of tax concessions 142. For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions,  I propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential house under sections 54 and 54F to ` 10 crore. Another proposal with similar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance policies with very high value. Rationalisation 143. There are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and simplification. Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by statutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of cities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an activity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax. Other major measures in this direction are: \\uf0b7 Removing the minimum threshold of ` 10,000/- for TDS and clarifying taxability relating to online gaming; \\uf0b7 Not treating conversion of gold into electronic gold receipt and vice versa as capital gain;  \\uf0b7 Reducing the TDS rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent on taxable portion of EPF withdrawal in non-PAN cases; and \\uf0b7 Taxation on income from Market Linked Debentures. Others 144. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to the following: \\uf0b7 Extension of period of tax benefits to funds relocating to IFSC, GIFT City till 31.03.2025; \\uf0b7 Decriminalisation under section 276A of the Income Tax Act; \\uf0b7 Allowing carry forward of losses on strategic disinvestment including that of IDBI Bank; and \\uf0b7 Providing EEE status to Agniveer Fund.', '33    Personal Income Tax 145. Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I have five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily benefit our hard-working middle class. 146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  ` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I propose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to pay any tax. 147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime with six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax structure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and increasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: ` 0-3 lakh Nil ` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent ` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent ` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent ` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent Above ` 15 lakh 30 per cent  148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An individual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  ` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 per cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, an individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  ` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent from the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  149. My third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners including family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of', '34    standard deduction to the new tax regime. Each salaried person with an income of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. 150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the highest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. 151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to increase this limit to ` 25 lakh. 152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax regime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the benefit of the old tax regime. 153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in the annexure. 154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  ` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be forgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. Thus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. 155. Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to this august House. *****', '35    Annexure to Part B of the Budget Speech 2023-24 Amendments relating to Direct Taxes A. PROVIDING TAX RELIEF UNDER NEW PERSONAL TAX REGIME A.1   The new tax regime for Individual and HUF, introduced by the Finance Act 2020, is now proposed to be the default regime. A.2   This regime would also become the default regime for AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP. A.3   Any individual, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI or AJP not willing to be taxed under this new regime can opt to be taxed under the old regime. For those person having income under the head “profit and gains of business or profession” and having opted for old regime can revoke that option only once and after that they will continue to be taxed under the new regime. For those not having income under the head “profit and gains of business or profession”, option for old regime may be exercised in each year. A.4   Substantial relief is proposed under the new regime with new slabs and tax rates as under: Total Income (`) Rate (per cent) Upto 3,00,000 Nil From 3,00,001 to 6,00,000 5 From 6,00,001 to 9,00,000 10 From 9,00,001 to 12,00,000 15 From 12,00,001 to 15,00,000 20 Above 15,00,000 30  A.5   Resident individual with total income up to ` 5,00,000 do not pay any tax due to rebate under both old and new regime. It is proposed to increase the rebate for the resident individual under the new regime so that they do not pay tax if their total income is up to ` 7,00,000. A.6   Standard deduction of ` 50,000 to salaried individual, and', '36    deduction from family pension up to ` 15,000, is currently allowed only under the old regime. It is proposed to allow these two deductions under the new regime also. A.7   Surcharge on income-tax under both old regime and new regime is 10 per cent if income is above ` 50 lakh and up to ` 1 crore, 15 per cent if income is above `1 crore and up to ` 2 crore, 25 per cent if income is above ` 2 crore and up to ` 5 crore, and 37 per cent if income is above ` 5 crore. It is proposed that the for those individuals, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP under the new regime, surcharge would be same except that the surcharge rate of 37 per cent will not apply. Highest surcharge shall be 25 per cent for income above  ` 2 crore. This would reduce the maximum rate from about 42.7 per cent to about 39 per cent. No change in surcharge is proposed for those who opt to be under the old regime. A.8   Encashment of earned leave up to 10 months of average salary, at the time of retirement in case of an employee (other than an employee of the Central Government or State Government), is exempt under sub-clause (ii) of clause (10AA) of section 10 of the Income-tax Act (“the Act”) to the extent notified. The maximum amount which can be exempted is ` 3 lakh at present. It is proposed to issue notification to extend this limit to ` 25 lakh. B. SOCIO-ECONOMIC WELFARE MEASURES B.1 Promoting timely payments to Micro and Small Enterprises In order to promote timely payments to micro and small enterprises, it is proposed to include payments made to such enterprises within the ambit of section 43B of the Act. Thus, deduction for such payments would be allowed only when actually paid.

      "[Document(metadata={'page': -1}, page_content='Budget 2023-2024  Speech of Nirmala Sitharaman Minister of Finance February 1, 2023 Hon’ble Speaker,   I present the Budget for 2023-24. This is the first Budget in Amrit Kaal. Introduction 1. This Budget hopes to build on the foundation laid in the previous Budget, and the blueprint drawn for India@100. We envision a prosperous and inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and citizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. 2. In the 75th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the Indian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is estimated to be at 7 per cent.

For commemorating Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, a one-time new small savings scheme, Mahila Samman Savings Certificate, will be made available for a two-year period up to March 2025. This will offer deposit facility upto ` 2 lakh in the name of women or girls for a tenor of 2 years at fixed interest rate of 7.5 per cent with partial withdrawal option. Senior Citizens 109. The maximum deposit limit for Senior Citizen Savings Scheme will be enhanced from ` 15 lakh to ` 30 lakh. 110. The maximum deposit limit for Monthly Income Account Scheme will be enhanced from ` 4.5 lakh to ` 9 lakh for single account and from ` 9 lakh to ` 15 lakh for joint account. Fiscal Management Fifty-year interest free loan to States 111. The entire fifty-year loan to states has to be spent on capital expenditure within 2023-24. Most of this will be at the discretion of states, but a part will be conditional on states increasing their actual capital'), Document(metadata={'page': 23}, page_content='25    expenditure. Parts of the outlay will also be linked to, or allocated for, the following purposes: \\uf0b7 Scrapping old government vehicles, \\uf0b7 Urban planning reforms and actions, \\uf0b7 Financing reforms in urban local bodies to make them creditworthy for municipal bonds, \\uf0b7 Housing for police personnel above or as part of police stations,  \\uf0b7 Constructing Unity Malls, \\uf0b7 Children and adolescents’ libraries and digital infrastructure, and \\uf0b7 State share of capital expenditure of central schemes.

The Revised Estimate of the total receipts other than borrowings is  ` 24.3 lakh crore, of which the net tax receipts  are ` 20.9 lakh crore. The Revised Estimate of the total expenditure is  ` 41.9 lakh crore, of which the capital expenditure is about ` 7.3 lakh crore.   114. The Revised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 6.4 per cent of GDP, adhering to the Budget Estimate.    Budget Estimates 2023-24 115. Coming to 2023-24, the total receipts other than borrowings and the total expenditure are estimated at ` 27.2 lakh crore and ` 45 lakh crore respectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 23.3 lakh crore.'), Document(metadata={'page': 24}, page_content='26    116. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 5.9 per cent of GDP. In my Budget Speech for 2021-22, I had announced that we plan to continue the path of fiscal consolidation, reaching a fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26 with a fairly steady decline over the period. We have adhered to this path, and I reiterate my intention to bring the fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26. 117. To finance the fiscal deficit in 2023-24, the net market borrowings from dated securities are estimated at ` 11.8 lakh crore. The balance financing is expected to come from small savings and other sources. The gross market borrowings are estimated at ` 15.4 lakh crore. I will, now, move to Part B.'), Document(metadata={'page': 25}, page_content='27    PART B Indirect Taxes 118. My indirect tax proposals aim to promote exports, boost domestic manufacturing, enhance domestic value addition, encourage green energy and mobility. 119. A simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps in reducing compliance burden and improving tax administration. I propose to reduce the number of basic customs duty rates on goods, other than textiles and agriculture, from 21 to 13. As a result, there are minor changes in the basic custom duties, cesses and surcharges on some items including toys, bicycles, automobiles and naphtha.  Green Mobility 120. To avoid cascading of taxes on blended compressed natural gas, I propose to exempt excise duty on GST-paid compressed bio gas contained in it. To further provide impetus to green mobility, customs duty exemption is being extended to import of capital goods and machinery required for manufacture of lithium-ion cells for batteries used in electric vehicles. Electronics  121. As a result of various initiatives of the Government, including the Phased Manufacturing programme, mobile phone production in India has increased from 5.8 crore units valued at about ` 18,900 crore in 2014-15 to 31 crore units valued at over ` 2,75,000 crore in the last financial year. To further deepen domestic value addition in manufacture of mobile phones, I propose to provide relief in customs duty on import of certain parts and inputs like camera lens and continue the concessional duty on lithium-ion cells for batteries for another year.'), Document(metadata={'page': 26}, page_content='28    122. Similarly, to promote value addition in manufacture of televisions, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on parts of open cells of TV panels to 2.5 per cent. Electrical  123. To rectify inversion of duty structure and encourage manufacturing of electric kitchen chimneys, the basic customs duty on electric kitchen chimney is being increased from 7.5 per cent to 15 per cent and that on heat coils for these is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. Chemicals and Petrochemicals  124. Denatured ethyl alcohol is used in chemical industry. I propose to exempt basic customs duty on it. This will also support the Ethanol Blending Programme and facilitate our endeavour for energy transition. Basic customs duty is also being reduced on acid grade fluorspar from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent to make the domestic fluorochemicals industry competitive. Further, the basic customs duty on crude glycerin for use in manufacture of epicholorhydrin is proposed to be reduced from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Marine products 125. In the last financial year, marine products recorded the highest export growth benefitting farmers in the coastal states of the country. To further enhance the export competitiveness of marine products, particularly shrimps, duty is being reduced on key inputs for domestic manufacture of shrimp feed. Lab Grown Diamonds 126. India is a global leader in cutting and polishing of natural diamonds, contributing about three-fourths of the global turnover by value. With the depletion in deposits of natural diamonds, the industry is moving towards Lab Grown Diamonds (LGDs) and it holds huge promise. To seize this'), Document(metadata={'page': 27}, page_content='29    opportunity, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on seeds used in their manufacture.  Precious Metals 127. Customs Duties on dore and bars of gold and platinum were increased earlier this fiscal. I now propose to increase the duties on articles made therefrom to enhance the duty differential. I also propose to increase the import duty on silver dore, bars and articles to align them with that on gold and platinum. Metals 128. To facilitate availability of raw materials for the steel sector, exemption from Basic Customs Duty on raw materials for manufacture of CRGO Steel, ferrous scrap and nickel cathode is being continued. 129. Similarly, the concessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap is also being continued to ensure the availability of raw materials for secondary copper producers who are mainly in the MSME sector. Compounded Rubber 130. The basic customs duty rate on compounded rubber is being increased from 10 per cent to ‘25 per cent or ` 30/kg whichever is lower’, at par with that on natural rubber other than latex, to curb circumvention of duty. Cigarettes 131. National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on specified cigarettes was last revised three years ago. This is proposed to be revised upwards by about 16 per cent.'), Document(metadata={'page': 28}, page_content='30     Direct Taxes 132. I now come to my direct tax proposals. These proposals aim to maintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise various provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the entrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. 133. It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department to improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our tax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; processed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period reduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  and 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend to further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form for tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism. MSMEs and Professionals  134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy. Micro enterprises with turnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  ` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide enhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers whose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support MSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for expenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is actually made. Cooperation 135. Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime Minister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi”, and his resolve to “connect the spirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the measures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative sector.'), Document(metadata={'page': 29}, page_content='31    136. First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till 31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is presently available to new manufacturing companies. 137. Secondly, I propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives to claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to assessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them with a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore. 138. Thirdly, I am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash deposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies (PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDBs). 139. Similarly, a higher limit of ` 3 crore for TDS on cash withdrawal is being provided to co-operative societies. Start-Ups 140. Entrepreneurship is vital for a country’s economic development. We have taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results. India is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks second in innovation quality among middle-income countries. I propose to extend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from 31.03.23 to 31.3.24. I further propose to provide the benefit of carry forward of losses on change of shareholding of start-ups from seven years of incorporation to ten years. Appeals 141. To reduce the pendency of appeals at Commissioner level, I propose to deploy about 100 Joint Commissioners for disposal of small appeals. We shall also be more selective in taking up cases for scrutiny of returns already received this year.'), Document(metadata={'page': 30}, page_content='32    Better targeting of tax concessions 142. For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions,  I propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential house under sections 54 and 54F to ` 10 crore. Another proposal with similar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance policies with very high value. Rationalisation 143. There are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and simplification. Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by statutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of cities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an activity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax. Other major measures in this direction are: \\uf0b7 Removing the minimum threshold of ` 10,000/- for TDS and clarifying taxability relating to online gaming; \\uf0b7 Not treating conversion of gold into electronic gold receipt and vice versa as capital gain;  \\uf0b7 Reducing the TDS rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent on taxable portion of EPF withdrawal in non-PAN cases; and \\uf0b7 Taxation on income from Market Linked Debentures. Others 144. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to the following: \\uf0b7 Extension of period of tax benefits to funds relocating to IFSC, GIFT City till 31.03.2025; \\uf0b7 Decriminalisation under section 276A of the Income Tax Act; \\uf0b7 Allowing carry forward of losses on strategic disinvestment including that of IDBI Bank; and \\uf0b7 Providing EEE status to Agniveer Fund.'), Document(metadata={'page': 31}, page_content='33    Personal Income Tax 145. Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I have five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily benefit our hard-working middle class. 146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  ` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I propose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to pay any tax. 147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime with six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax structure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and increasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: ` 0-3 lakh Nil ` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent ` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent ` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent ` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent Above ` 15 lakh 30 per cent  148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An individual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  ` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 per cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, an individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  ` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent from the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  149. My third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners including family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of'), Document(metadata={'page': 32}, page_content='34    standard deduction to the new tax regime. Each salaried person with an income of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. 150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the highest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the highest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. 151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment on retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- pm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to increase this limit to ` 25 lakh. 152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax regime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the benefit of the old tax regime. 153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in the annexure. 154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  ` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be forgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. Thus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. 155. Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to this august House. *****'), Document(metadata={'page': 33}, page_content='35    Annexure to Part B of the Budget Speech 2023-24 Amendments relating to Direct Taxes A. PROVIDING TAX RELIEF UNDER NEW PERSONAL TAX REGIME A.1   The new tax regime for Individual and HUF, introduced by the Finance Act 2020, is now proposed to be the default regime. A.2   This regime would also become the default regime for AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP. A.3   Any individual, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI or AJP not willing to be taxed under this new regime can opt to be taxed under the old regime. For those person having income under the head “profit and gains of business or profession” and having opted for old regime can revoke that option only once and after that they will continue to be taxed under the new regime.

A.4   Substantial relief is proposed under the new regime with new slabs and tax rates as under: Total Income (`) Rate (per cent) Upto 3,00,000 Nil From 3,00,001 to 6,00,000 5 From 6,00,001 to 9,00,000 10 From 9,00,001 to 12,00,000 15 From 12,00,001 to 15,00,000 20 Above 15,00,000 30  A.5   Resident individual with total income up to ` 5,00,000 do not pay any tax due to rebate under both old and new regime. It is proposed to increase the rebate for the resident individual under the new regime so that they do not pay tax if their total income is up to ` 7,00,000. A.6   Standard deduction of ` 50,000 to salaried individual, and'), Document(metadata={'page': 34}, page_content='36    deduction from family pension up to ` 15,000, is currently allowed only under the old regime. It is proposed to allow these two deductions under the new regime also. A.7   Surcharge on income-tax under both old regime and new regime is 10 per cent if income is above ` 50 lakh and up to ` 1 crore, 15 per cent if income is above `1 crore and up to ` 2 crore, 25 per cent if income is above ` 2 crore and up to ` 5 crore, and 37 per cent if income is above ` 5 crore. It is proposed that the for those individuals, HUF, AOP (other than co-operative), BOI and AJP under the new regime, surcharge would be same except that the surcharge rate of 37 per cent will not apply. Highest surcharge shall be 25 per cent for income above  ` 2 crore. This would reduce the maximum rate from about 42.7 per cent to about 39 per cent. No change in surcharge is proposed for those who opt to be under the old regime. A.8   Encashment of earned leave up to 10 months of average salary, at the time of retirement in case of an employee (other than an employee of the Central Government or State Government), is exempt under sub-clause (ii) of clause (10AA) of section 10 of the Income-tax Act (“the Act”) to the extent notified. The maximum amount which can be exempted is ` 3 lakh at present. It is proposed to issue notification to extend this limit to ` 25 lakh. B. SOCIO-ECONOMIC WELFARE MEASURES B.1 Promoting timely payments to Micro and Small Enterprises In order to promote timely payments to micro and small enterprises, it is proposed to include payments made to such enterprises within the ambit of section 43B of the Act.

B.2 Agnipath Scheme, 2022 The payment received from the Agniveer Corpus Fund by the Agniveers enrolled in Agnipath Scheme, 2022 is proposed to be exempt from taxes. Deduction in the computation of total income is proposed to be allowed to the Agniveer on the contribution'), Document(metadata={'page': 35}, page_content='37    made by him or the Central Government to his Seva Nidhi account. B.3 Relief to sugar co-operatives from past demand It is proposed that for sugar co-operatives, for years prior to A. Y. 2016-17, if any deduction claimed for expenditure made on purchase of sugar has been disallowed, an application may be made to the Assessing Officer, who shall recompute the income of the relevant previous year after allowing such deduction up to the price fixed or approved by the Government for such previous year. B.4 Increasing threshold limit for Co-operatives to withdraw cash without TDS It is proposed to enable co-operatives to withdraw cash up to ` 3 crore in a year without being subjected to TDS on such withdrawal. B.5 Penalty for cash loan/transactions against primary co-operatives It is proposed to amend section 269SS of the Act to provide that where a deposit is accepted by a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank from its member or a loan is taken from a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank by its member in cash, no penal consequence would arise, if the amount of such loan or deposit in cash is less than ` 2 lakh. Further, section 269T of the Act is proposed to be amended to provide that where a deposit is repaid by a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co- operative agricultural and rural development bank to its member or such loan is repaid to a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank by its member in cash, no penal consequence shall arise, if the amount of such loan or deposit in cash is less than ` 2 lakh. B.6 Relief to start-ups in carrying forward and setting off of losses The condition of continuity of at least 51 per cent shareholding for setting off of carried forward losses is relaxed for an eligible start up if all the shareholders of the company continue to hold those shares. At present this relaxation applies for losses incurred during the period of 7 years from incorporation of such start-up.

The period of incorporation of such eligible start-ups is proposed to be extended by one year to before 1st April, 2024. B.8 Gold to Electronic Gold Receipt The conversion of physical gold to Electronic Gold Receipt and vice versa is proposed not to be treated as a transfer and not to attract any capital gains. This would promote investments in electronic equivalent of gold. B.9 Incentives to IFSC Relocation of funds to IFSC has certain tax exemptions, if the relocation is before 31.03.2023. This date is proposed to be extended to 31.03.2025.

C. EASE OF COMPLIANCE C.1 Ease in claiming deduction on amortization of preliminary expenditure At present for claiming amortization of certain preliminary expenses, the activity is to be carried out either by the assessee or by a concern approved by the Board.
